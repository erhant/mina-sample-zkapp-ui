# Mina-Protocol Sample zkApp UI

This repository is the code for [Mina Protocol Tutorials #4](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/tutorials/zkapp-ui-with-react). I have uploaded it via GitHub Pages, as per the requirements of [zkIgnite, Cohort 0](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/zkignite-cohort0).

To see where I have made edits to change the repo-name to be used in gh-pages, see `next.config.js` and `reactCOIServiceWorker.tsx`.
